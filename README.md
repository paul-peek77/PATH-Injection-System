PATH‑Injection‑System v1.0

This project is provided for portfolio review only.  
No permission is granted for reuse, modification, or redistribution.

Overview
The PATH Injection System is a reversible, zero‑installation mechanism for temporarily adding portable applications to the system PATH on Windows. It enables full CLI access to tools stored in a portable directory without modifying system‑level configuration or requiring administrative privileges.

This project demonstrates:

- non‑destructive PATH manipulation  
- reversible environment changes  
- portable app workflow design  
- shortcut‑based command routing  
- safe cleanup and restoration  

Key Features
- Reversible PATH injection — no permanent system changes  
- Zero‑installation workflow — ideal for constrained or locked‑down environments  
- Portable app support — works from any directory  
- Automatic cleanup — restores the original PATH on exit  
- Shortcut‑driven command execution — simple, flexible, and easy to extend  

Purpose
This project was built to showcase systems thinking, cross‑platform scripting, and safe environment manipulation techniques. It is part of a larger portfolio demonstrating automation, developer tooling, and workflow engineering.
